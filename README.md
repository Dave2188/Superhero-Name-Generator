# Codeacademy Portfolio Project - Mixed Messages

## SuperHero Name Generator

The project called for a random message generator that returns a message to the console.

How I decided to go about this project was to:

1. Find all the necessary information
2. Create an object with the corresponding properties
3. Added a method to the object to loop through and gather random attributes
4. Push those attributes into an array
5. created a function to take the array values, join them into a string, and finally log them in the console.
